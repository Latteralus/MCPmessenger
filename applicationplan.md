# MCP Messenger Application Plan

## Project Overview
MCP Messenger is a self-hosted, offline messenger application with end-to-end encryption designed for secure communication on local networks. The application consists of an Electron-based client and a Node.js server with Socket.IO for real-time communication and SQLite for data storage.

## Current Status - March 12, 2025

- Express.js server implementation with Socket.IO integration
- SQLite database setup with proper schema
- User authentication system with JWT
- Message routing for direct and group communications
- End-to-end encryption support (public key storage and exchange)
- Admin API endpoints for user and group management

#### Client-side
- Electron application structure
- Login interface with key generation capabilities
- Chat interface for direct and group messaging
- End-to-end encryption implementation using TweetNaCl.js
- Admin dashboard for user and group management
- Build configuration using electron-builder
- UI/UX improvements:
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Dark mode with user preference saving
  - Message previews in contact/group lists
  - Unread message indicators and counts
  - Improved message storage and caching
  - Window size persistence

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Application packaging and distribution
- Testing on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance optimization
- Additional UI/UX improvements

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks
